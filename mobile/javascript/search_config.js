Today I am                                      proud  to  present  this  beautiful  melange  of  words,  emotion,  colours  and                                      imagination, the 107th Edition of Abhiyanta - 'Advay'!             The world around us is perceived in dualities, inﬂuencing every decision we make in our lives. Swaying             towards one end of the duality obstructs our personal success. The theme for this year explores humans             balancing between the two nodes of this dichotomy. 'Advay' embodies an optimistic message of evolution and             growth, a notion that resonates with each of us.             It was a great honour to work as the Editor for the past year, and carry on the glorious legacy of this magazine.             The personal journey I took as the Chief Editor and Secretary of Abhiyanta has been transformative. I was             blessed to have unwavering support from many people who kept motivating me at every step.             As you ruﬄe through the pages, I hope 'Advay' takes you on a journey of introspection, ﬁlled with tales of             bravery, melancholy, love and dreams.

As                जीना सीख...                           78         मी पािहलेला पिहला िहमवषा व           118  writers thrive on new experiences, the mono-tonous lack thereof led to content  creation being one of the most demanding unforeseen challenges. Today I am  proud  to  present  this  beautiful  melange  of  words,  emotion,  colours  and  imagination, the 107th Edition of Abhiyanta - 'Advay'!  The world around us is perceived in dualities, inﬂuencing every decision we make in our lives. Swaying  towards one end of the duality obstructs our personal success. The theme for this year explores humans  balancing between the two nodes of this dichotomy. 'Advay' embodies an optimistic message of evolution and  growth, a notion that resonates with each of us.  It was a great honour to work as the Editor for the past year, and carry on the glorious legacy of this magazine.  The personal journey I took as the Chief Editor and Secretary of Abhiyanta has been transformative. I was  blessed to have unwavering support from many people who kept motivating me at every step.  As you ruﬄe through the pages, I hope 'Advay' takes you on a journey of introspection, ﬁlled with tales of  bravery, melancholy, love and dreams.

Justice is             seldom just – it is envy disguised as an impartial precept; but all it is, is an             imbroglio of messy human emotions that could not be contained within the              mortal vessel.             “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye. shall ﬁnd; knock, and it shall be              opened unto you”                                                                                             - Ma hew 7:7                Less doors open for the blue bloods than the doors that close for those who've             lived in unchosen yet constant perusal of societal norms of the yesteryears. Envy              sleeps in the hearts of both factions, but only one of the two has means to act on             their covetous impulses; they are also the ones who deny justice to the rest –             humankind has never been humane.   #                                                         33","AÛ¶                                                                                                                    AÛ¶                                                                     ~«÷M¶©                                                                                                            am¡ú¶-amYg²                                                    Wmo‹S>m h¡ Wmo‹S>o H$s Oê$aV h¡,                                                                aUaUË¶m CÝhmV Vmo MmbV hmoVm.

My advice: choose an existing theme              If you see my work, you will notice that I did not allow                                                               because  I  am  no  longer  actively  involved  in  my   title?                                                               but  give  it  your  own  twist  and  character.  Is  every              myself to get compartmentalized. With the success of                                                                   family’s business. I’m usually at work for 5-6 hours   Surprisingly,  many  comparisons  between  the  Da                                                               sandwich the same? All sandwiches have two slices of              my Bharat Series, I could quite easily have basked in                                                                  but I do not a end oﬃce on weekends. I usually write   Vinci  Code  and  my  novel  The  Rozabal  Line  were                                                               bread,  but  each  product  is  remarkably  diﬀerent              the glory of being a history-mythology related ﬁction                                                                  in the mornings from 6am to 10am, which explains   made.  Now  I’m  aware  that  such  comparisons  are                                                               owing  to  the  variations  in  the  ﬁlling.  Make  a              writer. Instead, I took up the challenge of penning                                                                    why I have to start my day late. My evenings are   inevitable whenever one writes ﬁction that has Jesus                                                               sandwich that no one else has ever made.

I  am  an   Christ or Mary Magdalene as a backdrop. In reality,                                                               of  movies  and  books  have  derived  ideas  from  the              parallel, I spawned a self-help series, 13 Steps.

Other than that, I have   had spent almost two years reading every book that I                                                               borrowed  ideas  from  others!  There  is  a  ﬁne  line              in the world of ﬁction. I could also see myself writing                                                                virtually no social life.

I would rather burn it all to         “prole” and occasionally, “slave” is preferred for us   ground, dressed like it was some festival.             with an unused shovel in my hand. I hurried through   the  ground  before  agreeing  to  these  terms.  Return         because it implies a lack of self-respect and justice.   The incident raged a war between the Commission             the sun when my eye caught an unusual sight. I saw   only if you have some good news, else you know who                Master  Diluc,  on  the  other  hand,  managed  to   and the farmers, with protests, ﬁghts and even more,             Master  Diluc  lying  in  the  middle  of  the  barren   I am and what I can...\", Master Diluc was raging at the       somehow  survive  this  ﬁght  until  now  and  all  his   the decline of Galila. The plateau became inhabitable             drought-struck  land.  Although  I  was  tired,  I  just   bureaucrats from the Commission. Like a wise man,           impulsive, ignorant decisions have fetched him the   for both sides and people started to ﬂee Galila. The             sneaked past the fence and found a spot to lie down,   my  ﬁrst  instinct  was  to  get  out  of  the  mansion         name, \"Madman\". The Commission has now seized     desert  land,  \"Tierra  de  Dios\"  became  the  home  of             relieving myself from the burning sun. I wondered   unnoticed, before I was captured and engulfed by his               him  perfectly  into  their  trap.  He  has  no  way  to  go   proles.    The  rich  managed  to  se le  in  Elysia,  also             what Master Diluc was doing there in the so-called   fury. I was back on the road, trying to still contemplate         around  it  apart  from  accepting  his  \"fate\",  brought   known as \"Valle de lo Divino '', Valley of the Divine,             \"Tierra de Dios\", Land of God. No wonder it was a   what  had  just  happened.  As  I  tried  to  gather  my           upon by those who envied him rather than God.     although some ancient texts translate it to “Not the             boon, turning slaves into few of the richest men on the   thoughts, I overheard the bureaucrats laughing and           The  following  night,  I  pondered  upon  humanity's   realm of the dead.” Ironic again, isn’t it? But for how             plateau.  Years  passed,  and  the  land  never  failed  to   discussing the ma er.                                    beliefs and how we have managed to make this world   long can they sustain the sanctity? \"A term was coined             produce  the  best  co on  qualities  available  in  the   The Commission was sort of a government thing. I            \"a be er place but for a few.\" It was a peaceful night.   for the incident that acted as a catalyst in the war that             nation.                                           could never understand its whats’ and whys’ because                  Night-time was the only part of the day where I could   could have lasted for decades. \"Co on Gravestone'' is             Decades  later,  the  rivers  have  changed  course;  the   I  had  be er  things  to  worry  about  -  surviving      do things I liked. I could hope, think, question and   what the SOS named it. The rich quality co on that             God, people of Galila, have pleased and worshiped for   everyday.  All  the  farmers  had  to  go  through  an         dream. And abruptly, screeches and screams echoed   saw the rise of the economic capital of Galila, co on             years, has turned back on them. 3 successive years of   Oﬃcial procedure before selling their crops into the           through the \"Se lements of Slaves\", more popularly   that witnessed the rise of a humble slave to a wealthy             drought have toppled the castles of the rich. For us, the   market. What ﬁrst started as a survey later turned into    abbreviated to SOS. Ironic.                       murderer, co on which came in as a curse disguised             “proles”, life hasn't changed much. But in their case,   one  of  the  most  cunning  businesses  ever.  The           As I clothed myself in decent a ire and sped out, a   as a boon. Who else could \"Tierra de Dios'' blame, if             they weren't suited to live like us. How could they? As   Commission had an indirect decision over the rate of         black cloud had already covered the skies of Galila   not for the A ribution?             I  wondered  how  the Almighty's  power  could  even   the crops and thus milked the farmers. In protest and           and  this  time  literally.  The  Commission  TownHall                               Jayesh Raut             humble  the  crude,  a  small  child  wearing  beautiful   vengeance,  the  farmers  provided  the  Commission         was raging on ﬁre. Mumbled screams and prayers of                           T.Y. B.Tech Mechanical             robes came running across the desolated ﬁeld. He was   with  very  low-quality  products.  Therefore,  the             people trapped inside could be heard outside; after             wailing  at  the  top  of  his  voice.  There  was  some   Commission  had  to  incur  losses.  The  farmers  had      all, not that death deﬁes the rich. Everyone was doing             interaction between them, and then Master Diluc and   found some loopholes and managed to smuggle their                their  best  to  bring  the  ﬁre  under  control.  Still,  the             the  crying-brat  rushed  towards  the  mansion.

So,  even  when             one is the relationship with my friends. All the friends   lived so many of our memories.                              students  failed  a  few             that I’ve made at CoEP, we are all still in touch.

In today’s world, the way you             gave me that I am most grateful for.              people are learning through various sources. We had                  because we have not been recognized as a national   born with a set of capabilities and their capabilities are                                                                                                                                    level institute?                                  not in their hands; but making and breaking of habits             As an engineer, looking at things through a structured   limited sources - either books or professors. But now             lens  is  something  that  CoEP  has  taught  me.  Also,   things have changed. I am not sure nowadays how              Mr. Nimkar: I do agree with your comments.

The ﬁrst habit that I would                                                                                                                                                                                      like you to develop, and this is something I also ask my             whenever you say, “I am a student of CoEP”, the way   many  of  you  actually  spend  time  in  the  library.          now again here the responsibility falls back to us as                                                                                                                                                                                      managers to do - it is the habit of ‘constant question-             people look at you changes.

But now with marginal resources you can                   not just in terms of academic knowledge but in terms                                                               have access to the best possible information.                        of live exposure.

They                                                             problem at the same time you need to believe that                                                               are also far more risk-taking. I see my generation’s                 tutes can further increase the quality of education. But             would’ve liked to amp it up a notch. You realise the                                                                   what  you  mentioned  about  the  metallurgy  branch   there exists an optimal solution for it. Sometimes you                                                               risk-taking abilities and the current generation’s risk-             importance of discipline in later stages of your life.                                                                 kids from our time is absolutely right. Those students   will ﬁnd this solution by answering one question and             When you are young and full of energy you always   taking abilities; the la er have a higher set of abilities          were always in very high demand.                  sometimes you will have to answer four or ﬁve or even             tend to undermine its importance. But if this becomes   as far as risk-taking is concerned.  One point which I                                                           more questions. And while arriving at the solution                                                               feel is not too good is that - sometimes outcomes in life            Team Abhiyanta: Sir, you talked about generational             a habit then it starts paying you back because there is                                                                                                                  you will realise that it is a contextual solution. The                                                               aren’t  really  in  your  favour  and  that  needs  to  be           diﬀerences. What advice would you like to give to             absolutely no substitute to discipline in life. So, this is                                                                                                              same problem three years down the line will have a             one thing that I would like to revisit. Another thing   handled in a balanced way. I feel my generation was            engineering students like us who want to make a   new solution; ﬁve years down the line, the solution             that I would like to talk about to my 20-year old self is   much be er prepared for it than the current genera-        mark on this world? How should one structure one’s   will have changed, and the cycle continues. As the                                                               tion. So, I think this is one phenomenon that needs to               future in order to achieve the goals?             the “Art of Connecting the Dots”. I believe that it’s                                                                                                                    context changes your solution changes.   Third thing                                                               be understood and learned.             very vital.

Now coming to this question - why I went for             set of beliefs.  And again, I’ll come back to the art of   recall the day when my English pre-board paper was          of  the  very  ﬁrst  students  to  get  placed  from  the                                                                                                                                                                                      HBS,  despite  having  an  MBA  degree  from  a  very             questioning. To me it is very vital. Once you have this   circulated among all the students as an ideal paper. It      campus in engineering. I got placed in SKF bearings. It   prestigious college in India. However as you said, this             skill, it does not ma er which branch you are from,   was time for me to look back and say - “Well I came              was  a  dream  company  during  that  time.

And then           for ge ing into a management course. It was very clear   versus later studies - 20 to 25 years down the line. The             journey, from a teenager who came to CoEP with a   coming to engineering, the ﬁrst day I landed in Pune                to me that I wanted to do something that really really   objectives  in  both  are  world's  apart.  So  now  the                                                               for 11th grade admission, I passed by Coep in a bus.                 makes me look forward to doing it in the morning. So I             dream to actually becoming a person of your stature                                                                                                                      objectives at say, when you are doing an MBA at 23 or                                                               My father said to me - “Beta you have to come to this                felt  that  if  I  only  handled  the  production  line  or             and position? Could you just tell us your story, how                                                                                                                     24 years at Harvard are way diﬀerent than those of the             it all started - the day you realized you would have to   college after two years, this is your destination.” My       something similar, I would probably not enjoy it to   advanced management course that I did at 47-48 years             go  to  Pune,  how  the  graduation  happened  and   father set a vision for me - going to SP College was              that level or I would not be utilizing my true potential   of  age,  20  years  later.  The  outcomes  are  also  way                                                               only a stepping stone, Coep was to be the ultimate                   as an engineer. So that's where I decided  I would take             everything?                                                                                                                                                              diﬀerent. For the ﬁrst one - you are just entering the                                                               goal. And at that time I had no idea about IITs, so I                the  management  side.

Along with me I had 100 CEOs from the whole world             a village - till 10th grade I was in a small village that                                                               studying well and ge ing into Coep was the goal, so             had a population of about 8-9 thousand. For practical                                                                  Team Abhiyanta: So Sir, how was your experience at   who  had  joined  the  course.  Three  pronged  or  four                                                               once  I  received  my  12th  grade  marks,  I  applied  to             purposes it was called a taluka, but it actually was a                                                                 IIM Calcu a?                                      pronged objectives were looked into. First, Harvard is                                                               Coep, got in and came to Pune. That was the begin-             small  village  in  Solapur  district.  I  was  a  relatively                                                          Mr. Nimkar: When I passed out from IIM Calcu a, we   a case study based learning system. So they had about                                                               ning of this journey. I have one - you mentioned your             bright student, right from my ﬁrst standard to the last.                                                               had only four IIMs in the country and they were really   100  or  so  case  studies  from  diﬀerent  industries,                                                               father - there were many like us. In our batch I would                                                                 backgrounds, diﬀerent management and engineering             I was always a topper in my village, in my school. My                                                                  sought  after.  And  to  me  the  experience  was  a  life                                                               say, at least 80% + were lower or so called middle class             father  always  insisted  on  some  things  -  he  was  a                                                              changing experience. It wasn't about studying books   problems  that  were  a  part  of  it.  So  looking  at  100                                                               or lower middle class. Almost 30% of students were             teacher in the same school that I studied at. He always                                                                or  learning  management  skills,  it  was  about  the   diﬀerent top-level problems from around the world,                                                               from families where either their mother or father was             encouraged me to participate in debates in school and                                                                  empowerment of the candidate or the person with a   learning  from  that  was  the  top-most  objective.                                                               a teacher. But all of us were determined and disci-                                                                    Listening  to  100  other  people  having  diﬀerent             I always did; I won prizes at district and state levels. I                                                             skill set that would be useful in all realms of your life-                                                               plined students. So that has been the story. You put me             never realized then that this art that my father was                                                                   professional and others. So for me, the skill set being   perspectives  on  the  same  topic,  listening  to  their                                                               into my memory lane, talking about these things.             encouraging  me  to  learn  was  going  to  help  me                                                                   used in professional life was a subset of a bigger set of   opinions and thoughts was a huge learning experi-             throughout my life. And more so when I am at such a   Team Abhiyanta: Sir, after doing your engineering,               life skills. And that's where I mastered my skills of   ence.

So by the time I reached third year, I realized                                                         people  coming  from  diﬀerent  industries,  diﬀerent                                                             172                                                                                                                    173","AÛ¶                                                    AÛ¶     thing – that’s just the design of life.

And again, I’ll come back to the art of   recall the day when my English pre-board paper was   of  the  very  ﬁrst  students  to  get  placed  from  the                                                               HBS,  despite  having  an  MBA  degree  from  a  very  questioning.

So that's where I decided  I would take  everything?                                                  diﬀerent. For the ﬁrst one - you are just entering the  goal.

I sharpen my charcoal pencil of docile dutifulness       HOPE  to trace the perimeter of yet another – rotten fruit,   is a dizzy aberration from a routine of loathsome elegies i write for                                     myself. elysian days are a hoax i spill my paint bottles for –  a sedan with three wheels and an arboreal farm that had no fences – i filled in colours                               when scarlet and glassy blood blend into an amalgam that colours my skies  beyond the boundaries, askew and wild,   with a ray of oddly golden daylight – i drink from chalices   unprofessional to the trained eye that chants canticles   my sips, a periodic harmony on the harp that i dare not touch  from the yesteryears of privileged glory and bigoted laughter;   with the opposite of midas that                                                      i was born with –  I press my gentle fingers against raw wood to redraw    is that why i couldn’t ever colour within the boundaries?  lines and curves – mostly curves that aren’t straight –   is that why i turned our garden of love into a desert with no oases?  that would contain the plethora of colours i was born with;   it’s why i live in pauses of panic and it’s why i’ll be buried not beside Monet                              but with members of my brethren – we’re failed artists that feed on mortality,  sawdust on my rusty fingertips reminds me of                              flesh and blood are temporary but what remains is a legacy we couldn’t build;  a time when youth was liberty and personalities benign,   and i’ll remember your broken syllables until the sixth foot is dug,  seldom was hatred a dinner time staple and    i’ll remind myself of the only verity in a world of make-believe I built for myself – golden arches of the final abode  often was love the breakfast one wouldn’t skip;   weren’t a likely reality without your angelic eyes of reassurance and comfort.  but this Sunday evening,    I’ll observe you through the fabric of time – that’s what we are now; you were my hope, i turned you into a state of                                                           panic.   200                                                       201","AÛ¶                                                                                                                    AÛ¶                                                     Dilemma                                                 I stand at the edge of these walls                                              Between my dream and my past                                             One holds me with its time strings                                             The other pulls me in with ecstasy.

LATA MANGESHKAR                                                  EPILOGUE                           To  hope  is  to  suﬀer  in  silence  –  a  lifetime  of  eternal                           longing brings only heartache and stains of dry salt on                           cheeks that once ﬂowered under stars that resemble the                           divine arrow. But what is life without hope if not a series                           of vengeful aﬀairs culminating into an intense outburst of                           emotions? Earth (limbo) was cursed with inhabitants like                           humans – a wrath like none other; existence is continual                           and is the preservation of that very anger that birthed it.                           Timeless is the concept of home, for that’s where security                           ﬁnds  a  corporeal  form.  Walking  away  from  that  very                           home is accompanied by a hankering that can only be                           satisﬁed on return; for it is inevitable. In the meantime,                           hope is the ship to seek shelter on; it is bound to drown                           but under waves of uncertainty and pain lies a world of                           unexplored  darkness  that’s  seldom  accompanied  by                           light.  Hope  is  dangerous;  but  it’s  beautiful  to  the                           untamed, reckless to the disciplined and magnanimous                           to the ones who nary a soul.
